## Coffee Machine

This is a Python program that simulates a coffee machine.

### Menu

The coffee machine offers the following drinks:

- Espresso: 1.5 dollars
- Latte: 2.5 dollars
- Cappuccino: 3.0 dollars

### Ingredients

The coffee machine has the following ingredients:

- Water: 300ml
- Milk: 200ml
- Coffee: 100g

### Usage

To use the coffee machine, run the program and enter one of the following commands:

- `espresso`: Order an Espresso.
- `latte`: Order a Latte.
- `cappuccino`: Order a Cappuccino.
- `report`: Get a report of the coffee machine's resources.
- `off`: Turn off the coffee machine.

When ordering a drink, the coffee machine will check if it has enough resources. If it does, it will ask you to insert coins. Once you insert enough coins, it will dispense the drink and give you any change.

If you enter `report`, the coffee machine will print a report of its resources, including the amount of water, milk, coffee, and money it has.

If you enter `off`, the coffee machine will turn off.
